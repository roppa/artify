        I always wanted to be an artist. Being born in Newcastle to a working
        class mentality was not particularly conducive to an artistic endeavour
        - well that was my excuse. I didn't take up a brush until I was 37. Over
        a two week xmas holiday I had painted 10 canvases. They were described
        as 'naive', which was correct as I had never had a lesson. After
        starting work again I painted very seldomly. After you 'have' to work
        you lose interest. I lost interest in being the slave to degraded money
        so took up the brush again, vowing to become the greatest artist in the
        world.
